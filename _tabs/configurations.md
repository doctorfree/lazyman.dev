## Lazyman Supported Configurations

After [installing and initializing Lazyman](https://lazyman.dev/install),
additional Neovim configurations can be installed and initialized using
the `lazyman` command.

All of the supported Lazyman Neovim configurations can be managed using
the `lazyman` command interactive menu interface. The `lazyman` menu is
presented by invoking `lazyman` without arguments after the initial
bootstrap process is complete. Lazyman Neovim configurations can
also be managed with `lazyman` command line operations.

Currently 101 popular Neovim configurations are supported in the
following configuration categories:

- [AstroNvim configurations](https://astronvim.lazyman.dev)
- [LazyVim configurations](https://lazyvim.lazyman.dev)
- [LunarVim configurations](https://lunarvim.lazyman.dev)
- [NvChad configurations](https://nvchad.lazyman.dev)

- [Base configurations](#base-configurations)
- [Language configurations](#language-configurations)
- [Personal configurations](#personal-configurations)
- [Starter configurations](#starter-configurations)
- [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations)

### Base configurations

The Lazyman "Base" Neovim configurations are well tested, full featured Neovim
configurations that provide an excellent base starting point for exploring
the features of `lazyman` and the wealth of Neovim configuration possibilities.

All "Base" Neovim configurations can be installed and initialized with `lazyman -B`.

### Language configurations

In addition to the base Neovim configurations listed above, `lazyman` can
install and initialize several "Language" Neovim configurations. These can
be used as programming or document format specific Neovim configurations.
The `Language` category configurations either employ a specific language
or target specific language(s).

[Note:] The `Language` category does not include all supported Lazyman Neovim
configurations with programming language support. In fact, most Neovim
configurations support several programming languages. The `Language` category
simply serves as a convenience to get started exploring language support.

All of the "Language" configurations can be installed and initialized with
the command `lazyman -L all`. Individual "Language" configurations can be
installed with the `-L lang` option.

### Personal configurations

In addition to the base and language Neovim configurations listed above,
`lazyman` can install and initialize several "Personal" Neovim configurations.
These are used as personal Neovim configurations, so there are no guarantees
made about stability or compatibility. Each supported personal configuration
uses some interesting approach and provides significant value making them worthy
of study, exploration, and possible use in tailoring your own configuration.

All of the 'Personal' configurations can be installed and initialized with
the command `lazyman -W`. Individual 'Personal' configurations can be
installed with the `-w conf` option.

### Custom configurations

Lazyman includes support for `Custom` Neovim configurations. To install and initialize
a Neovim configuration not supported out-of-the-box by Lazyman, use the `-C url` and
`-N nvimdir` options to `lazyman`. After the installation and initialization completes,
set the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable to use the newly created Neovim configuration:

```bash
export NVIM_APPNAME="<nvimdir>"
```

Where `<nvimdir>` is the argument provided to `-N` above.

For example, to install and initialize the Packer based Neovim configuration
hosted at <https://github.com/VapourNvim/VapourNvim> and place it in
`~/.config/VapourNvim`, execute the command:

```bash
lazyman -C https://github.com/VapourNvim/VapourNvim -N VapourNvim -P
export NVIM_APPNAME="VapourNvim"
nvim
```

Sometimes people place their Neovim configuration in a repository subdirectory
along with other configurations in a `dotfiles` repo. To retrieve only the
Neovim configuration subdirectory in such a repository, use the `-b branch`
and `-D subdir` arguments to `lazyman` along with `-C url` and `-N nvimdir`.
If no `-b branch` is provided then the default git branch is assumed to be
`master`. For example, to install and initialize the Neovim configuration
hosted at <https://github.com/alanRizzo/dot-files> in the subdirectory `nvim`
with default branch `main`, place it in `~/.config/nvim-AlanVim`, and
initialize it with Packer:

```bash
lazyman -b main -C https://github.com/alanRizzo/dot-files -D nvim -N nvim-AlanVim -P
```

Note the `-b main` argument in this Lazyman command. When specifying a
subdirectory of a repository with `-D <subdir>` it is necessary to also
provide the default branch of the repository if not `master`.

Custom Neovim configurations may require additional setup work. Often
a custom Lazyman configuration will appear to work without issue but
contain references to `~/.config/nvim/` in its configuration files. For
example, a configuration's dashboard may contain a reference to
`~/.config/nvim/init.lua`. References like this can be fixed so the
configuration is relocatable by doing something like the following in Lua:

```lua
local config_path = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/init.lua"
```

Custom Neovim configurations will be displayed and available in subsequent
runs of `lazyman` in the Lazyman Menu System.

An excellent list of preconfigured Neovim configurations is available at the
[Awesome Neovim Repository](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#preconfigured-configuration). Many of these can be easily installed and initialized using
`lazyman -b <branch> -C <url> -N <nvimdir> ...`.

Feel free to open an issue at
<https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/issues> to help tackle any problems
installing or initializing Neovim configurations with Lazyman.

#### Custom configuration patches

If you encounter a Neovim configuration that does not cleanly initialize
with `lazyman` it is often possible to make a few minor changes to the
configuration to get it working. Lazyman supports custom configuration
patches that are applied during initialization of a configuration.

The `~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/scripts/patches/` directory contains patches
to Neovim configurations applied after cloning the repo with `lazyman`.

The patch file for a configuration must be named `<Name>.patch` where
`<Name>` is the name of the configuration folder in `~/.config/`.

Some Neovim configurations do not initialize cleanly using `lazyman`
and modifications to the configuration files may be necessary. In this
case it is possible to generate a patch file for the config, place it
here, and re-run `lazyman` to install and initialize that configuration.

The patch should be created from the top of the configuration directory
after making the necessary changes and backing up the original file(s).

For example, the Neovim configuration by [3rd](https://github.com/3rd/config)
contains references to a custom tree-sitter grammar and does not initialize
cleanly with `lazyman`. After commenting out these references a patch can be
created for this config with:

```bash
diff -Naur lua/modules/language-support/tree-sitter.lua.orig \
           lua/modules/language-support/tree-sitter.lua \
           > ~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/scripts/patches/nvim-3rd.patch
```

Subsequently, running:

```bash
lazyman -C https://github.com/3rd/config -D home/dotfiles/nvim -N nvim-3rd
```

will produce a cleanly initialized Neovim configuration.
