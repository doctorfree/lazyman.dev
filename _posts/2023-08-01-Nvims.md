## Introduction

The two primary features of the Lazyman project are the `lazyman` command
and the `nvims` shell function. The `lazyman` command provides a menu
interface and command line options to install, initialize, and manage
multiple Neovim configurations. The `nvims` shell function dynamically
generates a fuzzy searchable menu of Neovim configurations from which
to select. The selected configurations can be opened in Neovim, removed,
or a configuration information document can be viewed.

If selected for opening Neovim, the configuration selection is "sticky".
Subsequent invocations of `vi` will use the previously selected Neovim
configuration until another configuration is selected with `nvims`.

Help for the `nvims` and `neovides` shell functions can be found
in the `nvims` man page with `man nvims`, with the command `nvims -U`,
or in Neovim using the `nvim-Lazyman` configuration with `:h Nvims`.

## The nvims fuzzy selector

The `lazyman` installation and configuration automatically configures
convenience aliases and shell functions for Lazyman installed Neovim
configurations. One of these is the `nvims` shell function which dynamically
creates a fuzzy searchable menu of installed Neovim configurations and launches
Neovim with the selected Lazyman Neovim configuration.

See `~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/.lazymanrc`.

Similarly, a `neovides` shell function can be used to select a Neovim
configuration for use with the Neovim GUI `neovide`.

Both the `nvims` shell function and `neovides` shell function accept a
`-R` flag which indicates removal of the selected Neovim configuration.
Also supported is the `-C filter` option to `nvims` and `neovides` which
specifies a filter string to match when generating the list of Neovim
configurations to search and select.

The fuzzy searchable/selectable menu of Neovim configurations can also
be shown with the command `lazyman -S`. Note also that both the `nvims`
shell function and the `lazyman -S` command can accept additional filename
arguments which are then passed to Neovim. For example, to edit
`/tmp/foo.lua` with a Neovim configuration selected from the `nvims` menu:

```bash
nvims /tmp/foo.lua
```

Execute `nvims` directly at the shell prompt or by using the convenience
key binding `ctrl-n`.

Similarly, if `neovide` is found in the execution PATH then a fuzzy
selectable menu is provided with the `neovides` shell function and
convenience key binding of `ctrl-N` to bring up that menu.

The following command line options are available with `nvims` and `neovides`:

`-c command` : specifies an `Ex` command to be executed after the first file has been read

`-C filter` : specifies a filter to use when generating the list of configurations to select from

`-I` : indicates display of the selected Neovim configuration information document

`-R` : indicates removal of the selected Neovim configurations

`-S file` : Executes `Vimscript` or `Lua` in `file` after the first file has been read. If no `-S` argument is provided then `~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/overrides.lua` is used if not empty.

`-U` : displays a usage message and exits

Without arguments `nvims` and `neovides` generate a fuzzy search and selectable
menu of all Lazyman installed Neovim configurations. Neovim or neovide will be
opened using the selected configuration.

## Example nvims and neovides usage

`nvims` : presents a fuzzy searchable and selectable menu of Neovim configurations and opens Neovim using the selected configuration

`neovides` : presents a fuzzy searchable and selectable menu of Neovim configurations and opens Neovide using the selected configuration

`nvims -R` : presents a fuzzy searchable and selectable menu of Neovim configurations and removes the selected Neovim configuration

`nvims -C astro foo.lua` : presents a fuzzy searchable and selectable menu of Neovim configurations with names containing the case insensitive string 'astro' and opens the file `foo.lua` with Neovim using the selected configuration

The `nvims` shell function, when executed, presents a fuzzy searchable menu
of the `lazyman` installed Neovim configurations. The `lazyman` installed
Neovim configurations are maintained in the file
`~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/.nvimdirs`. Entries in this file are what `nvims`
uses for its fuzzy selection menu. When Neovim configurations are installed
or removed with `lazyman` this file is updated accordingly.

Note also that a convenience key binding has been created to launch
`nvims` with `ctrl-n`.

Similarly, if `neovide` is found in the execution PATH then a fuzzy
selectable menu is provided with the `neovides` shell function and
convenience key binding of `ctrl-N` to bring up that menu.

The `nvims` Neovim configuration switching shell function was created by
[Elijah Manor](https://github.com/elijahmanor). He created an excellent
[Neovim Config Switcher](https://youtu.be/LkHjJlSgKZY) video in which
he provides details on use and customization of the `nvims` shell function.

Lazyman has incorporated and adapted the `nvims` shell function for use
with the Lazyman installed Neovim configurations. The `nvims` shell
function is automatically configured during `lazyman` installation.

The `.lazymanrc` file also creates aliases for `ls`, `less`, and others
including a `tldrf` alias that allows fuzzy searching and selecting from
the list of cheatsheets supported by `tldr`. Try out the `tldrf` command
to quickly and easily display documentation for thousands of commands.
The idea for the `tldrf` alias came from another
[video by Elijah Manor](https://youtu.be/4EE7qlTaO7c).
