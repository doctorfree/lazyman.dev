<h1 align="center">Lazyman Neovim Configuration Manager</h1>
<p>
  The Lazyman project can be used to install, initialize, and manage multiple
  Neovim configurations. 100 popular Neovim configurations are supported.
  Lazyman provides a character-based menu interface as well as a weath of
  command line options. The Lazyman main menu looks like this:

<p>See <a href="https://lazyman.dev/news/">what’s new</a></p>
<p>
  Follow the <a href="#installation">Installation instructions</a> to bootstrap
  Lazyman. Once Lazyman is installed, execute the <code>lazyman</code> command
  to manage Neovim configurations. The <code>lazyman</code> command is located
  in <b>$HOME/.local/bin/lazyman</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The two primary features of the Lazyman project are the
  <code>lazyman</code> command and the <code>nvims</code> shell function. The
  <code>lazyman</code> command provides a menu interface and command line
  options to install, initialize, and manage multiple Neovim configurations. The
  <code>nvims</code> shell function dynamically generates a fuzzy searchable
  menu of Neovim configurations from which to select. The selected
  configurations can be opened in Neovim, removed, or a configuration
  information document can be viewed.
</p>
<p>
  More info on the <code>nvims</code> and <code>neovides</code> shell functions
  can be found below in the
  <a href="#the-nvims-fuzzy-selector">nvims fuzzy selector section</a>, in the
  <b>nvims</b> man page with <b>man nvims</b>, with the command <b>nvims -U</b>,
  or in Neovim using the <b>nvim-Lazyman</b> configuration with <b>:h Nvims</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>lazyman</code> command separates Neovim configurations into 5
  categories: <code>Base</code>, <code>Language</code>, <code>Personal</code>,
  <code>Starter</code>, and <code>Custom</code>. The <code>Base</code> category
  consists of well tested Neovim configurations and distributions, all of which
  provide significant value. The <code>Language</code> category includes Neovim
  configurations tailored for a specific programming or document format
  language. The <code>Personal</code> category includes personal Neovim
  configurations that provide significant value or demonstrate some cool
  features. Configurations in the <code>Personal</code> category are not
  necessarily intended for public use, these repositories are maintained for the
  personal use of the authors but are included here for their value. The
  <code>Starter</code> category includes Neovim configurations tailored to serve
  as a starting point for developing your own Neovim configuration. These
  include the popular Neovim <code>Kickstart</code> configuration, a
  <code>Modern</code> Neovim config, the <code>PDE</code> personal development
  environment config, and the Neovim configurations provided by the
  <a href="https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter">nvim-starter project</a
  >. The <code>Custom</code> category includes any additional Neovim
  configurations installed and initialized with <code>lazyman</code> by the
  end-user using the <code>-C url</code> and <code>-N nvimdir</code> options.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Lazyman installs and initializes the Lazyman Neovim
  configuration, a richly configured Neovim environment using Lua, Lazy, and
  Mason to support highlighting, completion, diagnostics, and more for many
  programming languages.
</p>
<p>
  The installation and initialization of Neovim configurations are placed in
  separate directories and managed using the
  <code>NVIM_APPNAME</code> environment variable.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>lazyman</code> command is installed as
  <code>~/.local/bin/lazyman</code> and can be used to install, initialize,
  remove, and manage multiple Neovim configurations.

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>
  I’m a lazy man. I wanted to try out a bunch of nifty looking Neovim
  configurations but I didn’t want to spend a lot of time setting each of them
  up and managing them. Instead, I spent a lot of time writing an
  install/initialize/manage tool I could use: <code>lazyman</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Although the primary motivation for creating this project was to provide an
  easy way to try out various Neovim configurations, <code>lazyman</code> can be
  used to setup and manage Neovim configurations tailored for specific purposes.
  A Neovim configuration for work, one for school, one for Python development,
  another for git repository maintenance and markdown editing, one with language
  servers and debugging tools, one for your mom.
</p>
<p>
  It’s also pretty interesting and educational to see how some of these
  <strong>Neovim Wizards</strong> setup their configurations.
</p>
<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
<p>
  Lazyman was inspired by several other Neovim distributions and configurations
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Allaman/nvim.git">Michael Peter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/loctvl842/nvim.git">loctvl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mrcjkb/nvim-config.git">Marc Jakobi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim">LazyVim</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim">LunarVim</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nvchad.github.io/">NvChad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ray-x/nvim.git">rayx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some of these distributions, like the work of Michael Peter, are released
  under an MIT license and I was able to copy directly configuration or
  initialization code. Others, like the work of Marc Jakobi, are released under
  a more restrictive license and I was only able to use these as reference but
  still a valuable aid. I copied my own previous work liberally.
</p>
<p>Thanks everybody!</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>
  See the <a href="https://lazyman.dev/notes">Notes section</a> for details on
  <b>Lazyman Notes</b>.
</p>
<h2 id="removal">Removal</h2>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/wiki/lazyman_command"
    >lazyman.sh</a
  >
  script can be used to remove previously installed Neovim configurations with
  the
  <code>-r</code> command line option. For example, to remove a previously
  installed <code>LazyVim</code> configuration, its initialized plugins, state,
  and cache, execute the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    $HOME/.config/nvim-Lazyman/lazyman.sh -l -r
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  To remove the <code>nvim-Lazyman</code> configuration and associated plugins,
  state, and cache:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    $HOME/.config/nvim-Lazyman/lazyman.sh -r
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  All <code>lazyman.sh</code> operations can be performed as a dry run with
  <code>-n</code>. For example, to see which <code>LazyVim</code> folders would
  be removed without removing any:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    $HOME/.config/nvim-Lazyman/lazyman.sh -n -l -r
  </code>
</pre>
<h2 id="known-limitations">Known limitations</h2>
<h3 id="interactive-neovim-configuration-initialization">
  Interactive Neovim Configuration Initialization
</h3>
<p>
  Lazyman does not support automatic initialization of interactive
  configurations. If the initialization process is interactive, the auto
  initialization will hang. Some effort is made to detect an interactive
  initialization and avoid a hung process. For example, if the configuration
  includes the
  <a href="https://github.com/wakatime/vim-wakatime">WakaTime metrics plugin</a>
  and no WakaTime configuration is detected then the user is prompted before
  continuing. Other configurations that prompt for an example config are handled
  by Lazyman but some custom configurations not yet supported by Lazyman may
  hang during initialization if they prompt for input.
</p>
<p>
  If the initialization process takes more than a few minutes it can be
  terminated with <code>Ctrl-c</code>. After termination the configuration can
  be manually initialized:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    NVIM_APPNAME="&lt;nvim dir&gt; nvim
  </code>
</pre>
<h3 id="external-configuration-dependencies">
  External Configuration Dependencies
</h3>
<p>
  Neovim configurations often rely on external commands, utilities, language
  servers, formatters, linters, and tools. The
  <code>Lazyman</code> initialization process installs much of what might be
  required but not all. Some configurations may initialize cleanly but
  subsequent use might provoke an error when an external dependency is not
  available. For example, the <code>nvim-Shuvro</code> Neovim configuration
  relies upon an externally installed <code>luacheck</code> facility. If this is
  not available then <code>nvim-Shuvro</code> will emit an error message when
  opening <code>lua</code> files. Most commonly used external dependencies are
  installed by <code>lazyman</code> but missing dependencies sometimes occur.
</p>
<h3 id="lazyman-neovim-configuration">Lazyman Neovim Configuration</h3>
<p>
  The installation of some programming languages is left to the system
  administrator. In particular, <code>lazyman</code> does not install Go, Java,
  the Java Development Kit (JDK), Composer, PHP, or Julia. These may show up as
  warnings when performing a <code>:checkhealth</code> and can be installed
  manually if needed. Some additional tools can be installed with
  <code>lazyman -I</code>.
</p>
<p>
  SSH users may need to install
  <a href="https://github.com/lemonade-command/lemonade">lemonade</a> to support
  the clipboard over SSH.
</p>
<p>
  If <code>go</code> is not installed or incorrectly configured then the Mason
  installs of <code>goimports</code>, <code>gopls</code>, and
  <code>gofumpt</code> will fail.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>dashboard-nvim</code> dashboard may display the tabline after
  performing some dashboard actions.
</p>
<p>
  Changing the configured dashboard from within Neovim via the Terminal display
  of the <code>lazyman</code> menu system will not take effect until a restart
  of Neovim.
</p>
<h3 id="updating-lazyman">Updating lazyman</h3>
<p>
  An update of the Lazyman configuration and <code>lazyman</code> command can be
  performed with the command <code>lazyman -U</code>. However, early releases of
  Lazyman always preserve any existing
  <code>~/.config/nvim-Lazyman/lua/configuration.lua</code>. Later releases of
  Lazyman include a different format for this file. When updating from an older
  Lazyman release it may be necessary to run the update twice.
</p>
<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h3>
<p>
  Homebrew can be used to install Neovim dependencies and tools by using the
  <code>-h</code> switch to <code>lazyman</code> or by selecting Homebrew when
  prompted. Using Homebrew on some Linux systems has the advantage of providing
  more recent versions of some packages. However, the Homebrew python package
  will be installed as a dependency and will appear first in your PATH. This
  results in a system which no longer recognizes previously installed python
  modules in the system python. This issue has been reported to the Homebrew
  team but is unlikely to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to use Homebrew and want to retain your existing python modules
  then the following manual process may suffice:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Locate the module paths the Homebrew python is using. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code
          >/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3 -c 'import site;
          print(site.getsitepackages())' | tr -d '[],'</code
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Locate the module paths the system python is using. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code
          >/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import site; print(site.getsitepackages())' | tr
          -d '[],'</code
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Append the system python module paths to <code>PYTHONPATH</code> with
    Homebrew’s first
  </li>
  <li>
    Export the constructed <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable in your
    shell init, e.g.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>export PYTHONPATH="&lt;colon separated list of paths&gt;"</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This Homebrew python module path issue is not a problem when using the native
  package manager to install dependencies and tools. This is the default.
</p>
<h4 id="ubuntu-20.04">Ubuntu 20.04</h4>
<p>
  The version of <code>luarocks</code> in the Ubuntu 20.04 default repositories
  is no longer supported. If <code>luarocks</code> is required then it can be
  installed manually by following the instructions in the
  <a href="https://luarocks.org/#quick-start">Luarocks documentation</a>. This
  is not an issue when using Homebrew to install dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  The binary distribution of the <code>tree-sitter-cli</code> npm package
  depends on GLIBC 2.32 but this is unavailable in this release of Ubuntu Linux.
  The <code>tree-sitter</code> command is not functional, disabling the
  <code>:TSInstallFromGrammar</code> command.
</p>
<h3 id="alpine-suse-and-void-linux">Alpine, SUSE, and Void Linux</h3>
<p>
  Due to limited resources, very little testing has been performed on Alpine
  Linux, SUSE Linux, or Void Linux. Support for these platforms was recently
  introduced and issues are expected. If you encounter a problem on these
  platforms please
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/issues">open an issue</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="semantic-token-highlighting-for-types-containing-hyphens">
  Semantic token highlighting for types containing hyphens
</h3>
<p>
  Neovim 0.9 introduced semantic token highlighting but placed some restrictions
  on the format of semantic tokens. For example, if a filetype contains a hyphen
  then language servers may return semantic tokens that contain a hyphen and
  this will generate an error. This issue may cause some configurations to hang
  or display errors.
</p>
<h3 id="latex-configuration-hangs-on-macos">
  LaTeX configuration hangs on macOS
</h3>
<p>
  The <code>nvim-LaTeX</code> configuration is hanging on my Mac. It appears to
  work fine on Linux platforms. This is currently under investigation.
</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
  The most frequent type of issue encountered using <code>lazyman</code> to
  install and initialize Neovim configurations is incompatibility between the
  existing configuration and Neovim supported configuration parameters. Lazyman
  uses Neovim 0.9 which includes revised support for several Neovim features.
  Many existing Neovim configurations rely on features or configuration
  parameters no longer supported in Neovim 0.9.
</p>
<p>
  For example, one of the most frequent issues initializing a Neovim
  configuration is the initialization error:
</p>
<pre><code>Parser not available for language &quot;help&quot;</code></pre>
<p>
  The Treesitter <code>help</code> parser was renamed to <code>vimdoc</code> and
  <code>help</code> is no longer supported as a Treesitter parser. These types
  of changes are called “breaking changes” and will occur more frequently when
  using a recent Neovim build. To correct a
  <code>Parser not available for language "help"</code>
  initialization error, locate where in the configuration the Treesitter
  <code>help</code> parser is set (usually in the
  <code>ensure_installed</code> section of the Treesitter plugin configuration)
  and change <code>help</code> to <code>vimdoc</code>.
</p>
<p>
  See the
  <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.9.0"
    >Neovim 0.9 release notes</a
  >
  for an overview of changes. In particular, many of these types of issues are
  detailed in the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/040f1459849ab05b04f6bb1e77b3def16b4c2f2b/runtime/doc/news.txt"
    >news.txt for Neovim 0.9</a
  >
  (<code>:help news</code> within nvim).
</p>
<p>
  This is life on the bleeding edge. However, all of the supported Lazyman
  Neovim configurations and most of the Personal Neovim configurations supported
  by <code>lazyman</code> do not have Neovim version incompatibilities.
</p>
<h3 id="lazyman-installation">Lazyman installation</h3>
<p>
  The installation process requires Neovim 0.9 or later. If not present the
  install script will attempt to compile current Neovim from source. This step
  can fail for a variety of reasons. Most typically, the Neovim build failure is
  due to missing libraries, header files, or development environment components.
  To debug a failed Lazyman installation, first run the install script in debug
  mode to try and determine the cause of the failure:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    brew update
    lazyman -d
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>lazyman -d</code> command should run the
  <code>install_neovim</code> script in debug mode and any errors will be
  displayed. Alternatively, execute the Neovim install command directly with
  <code>brew install --HEAD neovim</code> and view the output for errors.
</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="get-configuration-script">Get configuration script</h3>
<p>
  Neovim 0.9 introduced a new feature which allows execution of Lua scripts in
  Neovim from the shell command line. The <code>lazyman</code> configuration
  menu interface uses this new feature to get the current Lazyman Neovim
  configuration with shell commands like:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    GET_CONF="${HOME}/.config/nvim-Lazyman/scripts/get_conf.lua"
    confval=$(NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-Lazyman" nvim -l ${GET_CONF} ${confname} 2&gt;&amp;1)
  </code>
</pre>

The <code>get_conf.lua</code> script can also be used to retrieve option or
variable settings in any Neovim configuration. For example, to retrieve the
value of the ‘mouse’ option in the <code>nvim-Webdev</code> Neovim
configuration:

<pre>
  <code>
    GET_CONF="${HOME}/.config/nvim-Lazyman/scripts/get_conf.lua"
    NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-Webdev" nvim -l ${GET_CONF} mouse
  </code>
</pre>

<h3 id="lazyman-source-code">Lazyman source code</h3>
<p>
  The convenience script to install and initialize <code>nvim-Lazyman</code> is
  provided at
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/wiki/lazyman_command"
    >lazyman.sh</a
  >. The automated install and initialization is performed by
  <code>lazyman</code> and
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/wiki/install_neovim"
    >install_neovim.sh</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  View the lazyman.sh script in the
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/wiki/lazyman"
    >Lazyman Wiki</a
  >
</p>
<h3 id="install-neovim-and-tools">Install neovim and tools</h3>
<p>
  The <code>lazyman</code> command checks for a current version of Neovim and,
  if not found or if the existing version is less than 0.9, invokes the
  <code>install_neovim.sh</code> script to install Neovim, dependencies,
  language servers, and tools.
</p>
<p>
  Not all language servers and tools are installed. If additional language
  support is desired, it can usually be provided by Mason or Homebrew. For
  example, to provide support for Composer run
  <code>brew install composer</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The automated Neovim installation is performed by
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/nvim-lazyman/wiki/install_neovim"
    >install_neovim.sh</a
  >. View the <code>install_neovim.sh</code> script in the
